Q. How do CNN embeddings differ from HOG?
HOG uses fixed gradient orientations, while CNN embeddings are learned directly from data, capturing edges, textures, and damage patterns.

Q. Why CNN features work better for damage detection?
CNNs adapt to irregular shapes such as cracks and dents and are robust to lighting and background variation.
