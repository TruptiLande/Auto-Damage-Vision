This week focuses on understanding how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work internally and how they extend from image classification to object localization, including YOLO-style models.

Learning Goals

Understand why CNNs outperform classical computer vision methods
Learn how convolutions act as learned feature extractors
Visualize and interpret CNN feature maps
Build intuition for object localization
Understand YOLO-style object detection models


This week emphasizes fundamentals over implementation speed. Key ideas include:

Why hand-crafted features (HOG, SIFT) were replaced by CNNs
Feature encoding vs learned embeddings
What a convolution operation really represents
How CNN layers build hierarchical visual understanding
Transitioning from classification models to localization models
