This directory contains the Week 2 Computer Vision materials. All assigned exercises and notebooks for this week have been successfully completed. The goal of Week 2 was to build a foundational understanding of computer vision concepts and their application to vehicle damage analysis.

During this week, I worked through exercises covering:
Fundamentals of image processing
Feature extraction from images
Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Image classification techniques
Object detection basics
